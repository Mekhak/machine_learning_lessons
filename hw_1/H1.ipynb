    "### 1.4 - Normalizing rows\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common technique we use in Machine Learning and Deep Learning is to normalize our data. It often leads to a better performance because gradient descent converges faster after normalization. Here, by normalization we mean changing x to $ \\frac{x}{\\| x\\|} $ (dividing each row vector of x by its norm).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $$x = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    0 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n",
    "    2 & 6 & 4 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\\tag{3}$$ then $$\\| x\\| = np.linalg.norm(x, axis = 1, keepdims = True) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    5 \\\\\n",
    "    \\sqrt{56} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\\tag{4} $$and        $$ x\\_normalized = \\frac{x}{\\| x\\|} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    0 & \\frac{3}{5} & \\frac{4}{5} \\\\\n",
    "    \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{56}} & \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{56}} & \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{56}} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\\tag{5}$$ Note that you can divide matrices of different sizes and it works fine: this is called broadcasting and you're going to learn about it in part 5.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Define a **RandomGridSearch** function that takes as input arguments the estimator (an example could be log_reg()), the number of cross validation folds, and the possible values of the hyperparameters, in this case it is the learning_rate of the gradient descent in a list format (example alpha_grid = [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 5]). \n",

    "- Write a short description about the trained model and its performance in a way you see it. Describe the features you have used, which of them are the most important in terms of predicting the target and interpret in your words the performance metrics of the model. Use 5-7 sentences in maximum.\n",
